# Linear Regression Project

## Objectives: 
1. To wrangle the data, remove, null values and filter features to meet the brief's especifications.
1. Find the best key features to predict the tax assessed value of single unit properties that the tax district assessed during the months of May 2017 - June 2017. 
1. To generate and evaluate an effective linear regression model using key features to help predict property values.
1. To calculate tax rates and provide a visual distribution of tax rate for all counties that the properties are located in
1. Present the findings in report

## Project Brief:
> We want to be able to predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from those whose last transaction
was during the "hot months" (in terms of real estate demand) of May and June in 2017. We also need some additional information outside of the model.
> Zach lost the email that told us where these properties were located. Ugh, Zach :-/. Because property taxes are assessed at the county level, 
we would like to know what states and counties these are located in.
> We'd also like to know the distribution of tax rates for each county.
> The data should have the tax amounts and tax value of the home, so it shouldn't be too hard to calculate. Please include in your report to us the 
distribution of tax rates for each county so that we can see how much they vary within the properties in the county and the rates the bulk of the 
properties sit around.
> Note that this is separate from the model you will build, because if you use tax amount in your model, you would be using a future data point to 
predict a future data point, and that is cheating! In other words, for prediction purposes, we won't know tax amount until we know tax value.
